Sophia: Hey, Mark! I heard you're knee-deep in a C project. How's it going?

Mark: Hey, Sophia! It's been quite the adventure, but I've hit a roadblock with memory management.

Sophia: Ah, memory management can be a maze. What functions are you using for memory allocation?

Mark: Mostly malloc() for dynamic memory allocation.

Sophia: And are you remembering to free up that memory with free() once you're done?

Mark: Absolutely. I've been diligent about memory cleanup. But I keep running into segmentation faults when I access certain parts of my data.

Sophia: Hmm, that's puzzling. Have you checked your variable names and array indices for any slip-ups?

Mark: I've been using variables like ptr and index to navigate through the data. But perhaps there's a mistake hiding in plain sight.

Sophia: It's worth a closer inspection. A small typo can throw everything off. Have you thought about adding some print statements to track the flow of your variables?

Mark: That's a good idea! A little debugging could shine a light on the issue. I'll give it a shot and see if I can spot the problem.

Sophia: Sounds like a plan! Let me know if you need a hand. We'll crack this code puzzle together!
