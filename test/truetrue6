Sophia: Hey, Alex! How's your C coding coming along?

Alex: Hey, Sophia! It's been a bit challenging. I keep encountering syntax errors, and I'm not sure where they're coming from.

Sophia: Syntax errors can be tough. Can you show me the code you're working on?

Alex: Sure, here's a snippet:

c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n")
    return 0;
}

Sophia: Ah, I see a couple of issues here. First, you're missing a semicolon at the end of the printf statement. Second, you forgot to include a semicolon after the return statement.

Alex: Oh, right! Let me fix that.

c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}

Sophia: There you go! Now your code should compile without any syntax errors.

Alex: Thanks, Sophia! I appreciate your help. It's funny how such small things can cause so much trouble.

Sophia: No problem, Alex! We've all been there. Let me know if you run into any more issues. I'm here to help!
