Person 1: Hey, could you take a look at this C code I've been working on? I'm getting some weird errors and I can't seem to figure out what's going wrong.

Person 2: Sure, I'd be happy to help. Let me see the code.

Person 1: Here it is:

c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 5;
    int y = 0;
    int z;
    
    z = x / y;
    
    printf("Result: %d\n", z);
    
    return 0;
}

Person 2: Alright, let's see... Ah, I think I see the issue. You're trying to divide by zero here (x / y), which is causing a runtime error.

Person 1: Oh, right. That makes sense. I forgot about that. Thanks for catching that.

Person 2: No problem. You could add a check to see if y is zero before performing the division.

Person 1: Yeah, good idea. I'll do that.

Person 1 (after modification):

c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 5;
    int y = 0;
    int z;
    
    if (y != 0) {
        z = x / y;
        printf("Result: %d\n", z);
    } else {
        printf("Error: Division by zero\n");
    }
    
    return 0;
}

Person 2: Looks good. Now it won't crash if y is zero. Anything else you need help with?

Person 1: Not at the moment, but thanks again for your help. It's always good to have a second pair of eyes on code.

Person 2: Absolutely, anytime. Don't hesitate to ask if you run into more issues. Happy coding!
