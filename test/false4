Sophia: Hey, Mark! How's your C project shaping up?

Mark: Hey, Sophia! It's been a bit of a rollercoaster ride. Right now, I'm wrestling with some memory allocation woes.

Sophia: Ah, memory management can be a real headache. Which functions have you been using?

Mark: Mostly malloc() for dynamic memory allocation.

Sophia: And are you remembering to free() that memory once you're done with it?

Mark: Absolutely. I've been careful to clean up after myself. But I keep hitting segmentation faults when I try to access certain parts of my data.

Sophia: Hmm, that's frustrating. Have you double-checked your variable names and array indices for any errors?

Mark: I've been using variables like ptr and index to navigate through the data. But maybe I've overlooked something.

Sophia: It happens to the best of us! Have you considered adding some print statements to trace the flow of your variables?

Mark: That's a good suggestion! A little extra visibility might reveal where things are going wrong. I'll give it a shot and see if I can spot the problem.

Sophia: Great! Let me know if you need a fresh set of eyes on your code. We'll tackle this challenge together!
