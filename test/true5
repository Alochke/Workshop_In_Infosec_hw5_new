Alex: Hey, Sarah! I've been diving deep into this C source code for our project. Want to take a look and give me some feedback?

Sarah: Sure thing, Alex! I'd be happy to help. What specifically are you working on?

Alex: I've been optimizing our sorting algorithm to improve performance. Here's the code snippet:

c

#include <stdio.h>

void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]) {
                int temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j+1];
                arr[j+1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};
    int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
    bubbleSort(arr, n);
    printf("Sorted array: \n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}

Sarah: Ah, bubble sort! It's a classic algorithm. Have you considered using a more efficient sorting algorithm like quicksort or mergesort?

Alex: I did some research, and bubble sort seemed like a good starting point since it's easy to implement. But you're right, we could definitely explore other options for better performance.

Sarah: Absolutely! Depending on the size and nature of the data, a different algorithm might be more suitable. Let's discuss the requirements and constraints of our project to determine the best approach.

Alex: Sounds like a plan, Sarah! Thanks for your input. I'll keep exploring different sorting algorithms to see which one fits our needs best.

Sarah: Anytime, Alex! Let me know if you need assistance with testing or optimization. Teamwork makes the dream work!
