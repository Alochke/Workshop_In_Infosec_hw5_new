Sophia: Hey, Alex! How's your C programming adventure unfolding?

Alex: Hey, Sophia! It's been quite the challenge. I keep bumping into syntax errors, and it's slowing me down.

Sophia: Syntax errors can be tricky to spot. Mind sharing the code you're working on?

Alex: Sure thing! Here's a snippet:

c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n")
    return 0;
}

Sophia: Ah, I see a couple of issues here. First, you forgot to add a semicolon at the end of the printf statement. Second, you're missing a semicolon after the return statement.

Alex: Oh, right! Let me fix that.

c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}

Sophia: There you go! Now your code should compile without any syntax errors.

Alex: Thanks a bunch, Sophia! It's amazing how such small mistakes can throw everything off.

Sophia: It happens to the best of us! Don't hesitate to ask if you run into any more roadblocks. I'm here to help!
