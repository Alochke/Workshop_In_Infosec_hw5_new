Alex: Hey, Sarah! I've been working on optimizing this C source code for our project, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it right. Mind taking a look?

Sarah: Of course, Alex! I'd be happy to help. Let's see what you've got.

c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        sum += i;
    }
    printf("The sum is: %d\n", sum);
    return 0;
}

Alex: This program calculates the sum of the numbers from 0 to 99 using a for loop. I'm trying to optimize it to make it run faster. Do you have any suggestions?

Sarah: Well, one optimization you could make is to pre-calculate the sum instead of looping through all the numbers. Since it's an arithmetic series, you can use the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers: sum=n×(n+1)2sum=2n×(n+1)​.

Alex: That's a great idea! So I would just need to calculate 100×(100+1)22100×(100+1)​?

Sarah: Exactly! That would give you the sum of the numbers from 0 to 99 without needing to loop through each individual number.

Alex: Let me make that change and see if it improves the performance of the program. Thanks for the suggestion, Sarah!

Sarah: No problem, Alex! Let me know if you need any further assistance.
