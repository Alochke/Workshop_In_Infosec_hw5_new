Sophia: Hey, Alex! I heard you've been exploring JavaScript lately. What's sparked your interest?

Alex: Hey, Sophia! Yeah, I've been hearing a lot about JavaScript's versatility and its role in web development. I thought it was time to dive in and see what all the fuss is about.

Sophia: That's a great decision! JavaScript is indeed a powerful language, especially for building interactive web applications. Have you started working on any projects yet?

Alex: I'm still in the early stages, but I've been experimenting with building a simple to-do list app. Here's a snippet of what I've got so far:

javascript

let todos = [];

function addTodo(todo) {
    todos.push(todo);
    displayTodos();
}

function displayTodos() {
    const todoList = document.getElementById('todo-list');
    todoList.innerHTML = '';
    
    todos.forEach(todo => {
        const li = document.createElement('li');
        li.textContent = todo;
        todoList.appendChild(li);
    });
}

function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    const todoInput = document.getElementById('todo-input');
    const todoText = todoInput.value.trim();
    if (todoText !== '') {
        addTodo(todoText);
        todoInput.value = '';
    }
}

document.getElementById('todo-form').addEventListener('submit', handleSubmit);

Sophia: Nice! Building a to-do list app is a classic way to get started with JavaScript. I see you're already handling user input and dynamically updating the UI.

Alex: Yeah, it's been fun getting my hands dirty with JavaScript. The language feels quite flexible, and there's a wealth of resources available for learning and development.

Sophia: Absolutely! JavaScript's popularity means there's no shortage of tutorials, documentation, and community support. Let me know if you need any help with your to-do list app or any other JavaScript projects. I'm here to assist!

Alex: Thanks, Sophia! I'll definitely keep that in mind. I'm excited to continue my JavaScript journey and see what I can create!
