Sophia: Hey, Mark! Heard you've been deep into your C project. How's it unfolding?

Mark: Hey, Sophia! It's been a whirlwind. Currently, I'm tackling some memory management hurdles.

Sophia: Memory management, eh? Which functions have you been relying on?

Mark: Mostly malloc() for dynamic memory allocation.

Sophia: And you're not forgetting to free() that memory once you're done, right?

Mark: Absolutely. I've been meticulous with cleanup. But I keep encountering segmentation faults during data access.

Sophia: Segmentation faults are tricky. Have you scrutinized your variable names and array indices for any missteps?

Mark: I've been using variables like ptr and index, but there might be room for error.

Sophia: It happens! Have you considered peppering your code with debug print statements to track variable behavior?

Mark: Not a bad idea! A little extra insight might shed some light on the issue. I'll give it a shot and see if it leads anywhere.

Sophia: Sounds like a plan! Give me a shout if you hit a snag. We'll crack this code puzzle together!
