Sophia: Hey, Alex! I heard you've been working on some C code. How's it coming along?

Alex: Hey, Sophia! It's been a bit challenging, to be honest. I keep running into syntax errors, and I'm not sure how to fix them.

Sophia: Syntax errors can be tricky. What seems to be the problem?

Alex: Well, let me show you a snippet of the code I'm working on:

c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n")
    return 0;
}

Sophia: Ah, I see the issue. You're missing a semicolon at the end of the printf statement.

Alex: Oh, right! Silly mistake. Let me fix that.

c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}

Sophia: There you go! That should resolve the syntax error.

Alex: Thanks, Sophia! I really appreciate your help. It's amazing how a small error like that can cause so much trouble.

Sophia: No problem, Alex! We've all been there. Let me know if you run into any more issues. I'm here to help!
