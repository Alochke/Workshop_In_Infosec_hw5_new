Sophia: Hey, Mark! How's your C project progressing?

Mark: Hey, Sophia! It's been a journey, but I'm currently wrestling with some memory management hurdles.

Sophia: Memory management can be a maze. Which functions have you been employing?

Mark: Mostly malloc() for dynamic memory allocation.

Sophia: And have you been diligent about free()-ing up that memory once you're done?

Mark: Absolutely. I've been thorough with memory cleanup. But I keep encountering segmentation faults when accessing certain data points.

Sophia: That's perplexing. Have you scrutinized your variable names and array indices for any anomalies?

Mark: I've been utilizing variables like ptr and index for data traversal. However, it's plausible I've missed a detail.

Sophia: It's worth a meticulous review. Sometimes, even the smallest oversight can wreak havoc. Have you contemplated adding debug print statements to trace the flow of your variables?

Mark: That's a stellar idea! Extra insight might unveil the source of the issue. I'll implement it and see if I can uncover the root cause.

Sophia: Fantastic! Feel free to reach out if you require assistance. We'll decipher this code conundrum together!
