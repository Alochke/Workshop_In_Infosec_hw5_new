David: Hey, Mia! I'm trying to understand this C code for a sorting algorithm, but I'm getting a bit confused. Can you help me out?

Mia: Of course, David! Let's take a look at it together.

c

#include <stdio.h>

void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++) {
            if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]) {
                int temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[j+1];
                arr[j+1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};
    int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
    bubbleSort(arr, n);
    printf("Sorted array: \n");
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}

David: So, this code seems to be implementing the bubble sort algorithm, right?

Mia: That's correct, David! Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

David: Ah, I see. But I'm having trouble understanding the nested for loops in the bubbleSort function.

Mia: No problem! The outer loop iterates over the entire array, while the inner loop iterates from the beginning of the array up to n-i-1. This is because after each iteration of the outer loop, the largest element bubbles up to the end of the array, so we don't need to compare it again.

David: That makes sense! And the if statement inside the inner loop is where the swapping happens, right?

Mia: Exactly! If the element at index j is greater than the element at index j+1, we swap them to ensure that the array is sorted in ascending order.

David: Thanks for the explanation, Mia! I think I understand it much better now.
