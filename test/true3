Jack: Hey, Emma! I'm having some trouble understanding this C source code. Could you help me out?

Emma: Of course, Jack! Let's take a look at it together.

c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 5;
    int y = 10;
    int z = x + y;
    
    printf("The sum of %d and %d is %d\n", x, y, z);
    
    return 0;
}

Jack: This code seems straightforward, but I'm not entirely sure how the printf function works with the %d placeholders.

Emma: Ah, I see. The %d placeholders in the printf function are format specifiers. They tell printf to replace them with the corresponding integer values provided as arguments after the format string.

Jack: So in this case, %d is replaced by the values of x, y, and z respectively?

Emma: Exactly! When printf is executed, it substitutes %d with the values of x, y, and z in the order they appear in the argument list.

Jack: That makes sense now! Thanks for clearing that up, Emma.

Emma: No problem, Jack! Let me know if you have any more questions about this code or anything else related to C programming.
