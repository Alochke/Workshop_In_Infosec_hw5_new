Person 1: Hey, could you take a look at this C code I've been working on? I'm getting some strange syntax errors and I can't seem to pinpoint what's wrong.

Person 2: Sure, let me see the code.

Person 1: Here's what I've got:

c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 5;
    int y = 3;
    int z;
    
    z = x + y
    
    printf("Result: %d\n", z);
    
    return 0;
}

Person 2: Alright, let's take a look... Ah, I see the issue. You're missing a semicolon after the line z = x + y.

Person 1: Oh, right. I forgot about that. Thanks for catching it.

Person 1 (after modification):

c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 5;
    int y = 3;
    int z;
    
    z = x + y;
    
    printf("Result: %d\n", z);
    
    return 0;
}

Person 2: Perfect, that should fix the syntax error. Anything else giving you trouble?

Person 1: Not at the moment, but thanks for your help. It's always good to have someone to bounce ideas off of.

Person 2: Absolutely, happy to help. Let me know if you run into any more issues.
