Alex: Hey, Mia! I've been diving into Go lately, and I'm pretty excited about it.

Mia: That's awesome, Alex! What got you interested in Go?

Alex: Well, I've heard a lot about its simplicity and efficiency, especially for building scalable web applications. So, I thought I'd give it a try.

Mia: That's a solid reason! Have you started working on any projects yet?

Alex: Yeah, I'm currently building a RESTful API for a small e-commerce website. Here's a snippet of the code I've been working on:

go

package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"log"
	"net/http"
)

type Product struct {
	ID    string  `json:"id"`
	Name  string  `json:"name"`
	Price float64 `json:"price"`
}

var products []Product

func getProducts(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
	json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(products)
}

func main() {
	products = append(products, Product{ID: "1", Name: "Phone", Price: 499.99})
	http.HandleFunc("/products", getProducts)
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}

Mia: Nice! You're already diving into building APIs. Go's standard library makes it pretty straightforward, doesn't it?

Alex: Definitely! I'm impressed by how clean and concise the code is compared to some other languages I've used for web development.

Mia: It's great to see you exploring new technologies, Alex. Let me know if you need any help with your Go project. I'd be happy to lend a hand!

Alex: Thanks, Mia! I'll definitely keep that in mind. I'm excited to see where this Go journey takes me.
