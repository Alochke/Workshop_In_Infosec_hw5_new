Sophia: Hey, Alex! How's your C coding journey going?

Alex: Hey, Sophia! It's been quite the ride. I keep stumbling upon syntax errors, and it's driving me nuts!

Sophia: Ah, syntax errors can be a real pain. Mind showing me the code you're working on?

Alex: Of course! Here's a snippet:

c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n")
    return 0;
}

Sophia: I see a couple of issues here. First, you're missing a semicolon at the end of the printf statement. Second, you've forgotten to include <stdlib.h> for the return statement.

Alex: Oh, right! Let me fix that.

c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() 
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}

Sophia: There you go! Now your code should compile without any syntax errors.

Alex: Thanks a bunch, Sophia! It's incredible how such minor mistakes can cause such frustration.

Sophia: Absolutely! Programming can be like solving a puzzle sometimes. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need any more help. I'm here for you!
