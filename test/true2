Sophie: Hey, Ryan! I noticed you're working on some C code. What's it about?

Ryan: Hey, Sophie! Yeah, I'm working on a program that calculates the factorial of a number.

Sophie: Oh, that sounds interesting! Mind showing me the code?

Ryan: Sure thing! Here it is:

c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num;
    long long factorial = 1;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);

    for (int i = 1; i <= num; ++i) {
        factorial *= i;
    }

    printf("The factorial of %d is %lld\n", num, factorial);

    return 0;
}

Sophie: Ah, I see what you're doing. You're using a for loop to multiply each number from 1 to the input number to calculate the factorial, right?

Ryan: Exactly! It's a simple and efficient way to compute factorials.

Sophie: Looks good to me! But have you considered what happens if the user enters a negative number?

Ryan: Hmm, you're right. I should add some input validation to ensure the number entered is non-negative.

Sophie: That's a good idea. It's always important to handle edge cases like that to make your program more robust.

Ryan: Thanks for the reminder, Sophie! I'll add input validation right away.
